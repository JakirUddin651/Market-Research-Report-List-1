<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pumps for Oil & Gas Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Pumps</li><li>Positive Displacement Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The oil and gas market utilizes two primary pump types: centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps rely on rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for high-flow applications with low viscosity liquids. They are commonly used in transporting crude oil and refined products. In contrast, positive displacement pumps operate by trapping a fixed volume of fluid and forcing it through the discharge, making them suitable for high-viscosity or high-pressure applications, such as in hydraulic fracturing and mud circulation.</p></p>
