<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Auto Transfusion System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Continuous Autotransfusion Systems</li><li>Discontinuous Autotransfusion Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The auto transfusion system market is divided into two main types: continuous autotransfusion systems and discontinuous autotransfusion systems. Continuous autotransfusion systems enable real-time blood collection and reinfusion during surgical procedures, promoting seamless blood management and minimizing waste. In contrast, discontinuous autotransfusion systems collect blood at specified intervals, typically after significant blood loss, for later reinfusion. Both systems enhance patient outcomes by reducing the need for donor blood, lowering infection risks, and improving overall transfusion efficiency in clinical settings.</p></p>
