<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasound Probe Disinfection System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-level Disinfection</li><li>Intermediate/Low-level Disinfection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The ultrasound probe disinfection system market encompasses two primary types based on the level of disinfection: high-level disinfection and intermediate/low-level disinfection. High-level disinfection involves processes that eliminate all microorganisms except large numbers of bacterial spores, making it suitable for semi-invasive procedures. Intermediate/low-level disinfection, on the other hand, targets a narrower spectrum of pathogens and is effective for non-critical items or surfaces that come into contact with intact skin. Both types ensure patient safety and infection control in healthcare settings.</p></p>
