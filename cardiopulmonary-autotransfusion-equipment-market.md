<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unwashed ATS</li><li>Washed ATS</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cardiopulmonary Autotransfusion Equipment market includes two primary types: unwashed autotransfusion systems (ATS) and washed ATS. Unwashed ATS recycles the blood lost during surgery without additional processing, making it a quicker option but with potential contaminants. In contrast, washed ATS involves processing the collected blood to remove impurities and cellular debris, resulting in a cleaner and safer product for transfusion. This distinction influences clinical preferences, depending on patient safety and efficacy requirements during surgical procedures.</p></p>
