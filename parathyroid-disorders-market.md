<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Parathyroid Disorders Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hyperparathyroidism</li><li>Parathyroid Cancer</li><li>Hypoparathyroidism</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The parathyroid disorders market is segmented into hyperparathyroidism, parathyroid cancer, and hypoparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism, characterized by overproduction of parathyroid hormone, leads to elevated calcium levels and bone-related issues. Parathyroid cancer, a rare malignancy, involves the growth of tumors in parathyroid glands, causing severe hormonal imbalances. Hypoparathyroidism, conversely, results from inadequate hormone production, leading to low calcium levels and associated complications. Each disorder presents unique clinical challenges, driving the demand for targeted therapies and management strategies.</p></p>
