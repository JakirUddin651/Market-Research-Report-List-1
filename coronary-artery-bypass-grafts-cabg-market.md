<p><p>Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) is a surgical procedure used to treat coronary artery disease by creating a new path for blood to flow to the heart. This is achieved by grafting vessels taken from other parts of the body, such as the leg or chest, to bypass blocked or narrowed arteries. The procedure is often necessary for patients with significant blockages that cannot be managed through medication or angioplasty.</p><p>The CABG market is experiencing significant growth, driven by the rising incidence of coronary artery diseases, an aging population, and increasing awareness of cardiovascular health. Innovative surgical techniques and advancements in graft materials are enhancing treatment outcomes, further fueling market expansion. Additionally, the growing prevalence of lifestyle-related factors such as obesity and diabetes contributes to the demand for CABG procedures.</p><p>The Coronary Artery Bypass Grafts (CABG) Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% during the forecast period. Emerging markets also show potential for significant growth, as healthcare infrastructure improves and access to advanced medical technologies increases. As patient outcomes continue to improve, the CABG market remains a vital component of cardiovascular treatment strategies.</p></p>
