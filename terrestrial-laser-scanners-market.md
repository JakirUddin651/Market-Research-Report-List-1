<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Terrestrial Laser Scanners Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Phase Based Scanners</li><li>Time-Of-Flight Scanners</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The terrestrial laser scanners market primarily features two types: phase-based scanners and time-of-flight scanners. Phase-based scanners utilize the phase shift of laser light to quickly capture high-density point clouds with precision, making them suitable for detailed surveying and modeling. In contrast, time-of-flight scanners calculate distances by measuring the time it takes for a laser pulse to return after reflecting off an object, offering longer range capabilities but typically at lower resolution. Both technologies serve different applications in topography, architecture, and construction.</p></p>
