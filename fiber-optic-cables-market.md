<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber Optic Cables Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber optic cables market is primarily divided into two types: single-mode and multi-mode fibers. Single-mode fibers have a smaller core diameter, allowing only one light mode to propagate, which leads to higher bandwidth and longer transmission distances, making them ideal for telecommunications and long-distance networks. In contrast, multi-mode fibers have a larger core, enabling multiple light modes to travel simultaneously, suited for shorter distances like within buildings or campus networks. Each type serves specific applications based on distance and bandwidth requirements.</p></p>
