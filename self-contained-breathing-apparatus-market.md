<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-contained Breathing Apparatus Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Circuit SCBA</li><li>Closed-Circuit SCBA</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Self-contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) market comprises two main types: Open-Circuit SCBA and Closed-Circuit SCBA. Open-Circuit SCBA releases exhaled air into the environment, utilizing compressed oxygen for breathing, making it suitable for firefighting and rescue operations. In contrast, Closed-Circuit SCBA recycles exhaled air by removing carbon dioxide and reintroducing oxygen, allowing for longer use in oxygen-deficient environments, such as underwater or in confined spaces. Both types serve critical roles in safety and emergency response.</p></p>
