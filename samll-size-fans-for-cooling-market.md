<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Samll Size Fans for Cooling Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small size fans for cooling encompass two primary types: axial fans and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air along the axis of the fan, offering high airflow rates and low pressure, making them well-suited for ventilation in compact spaces. In contrast, centrifugal fans operate by drawing air into the fan and expelling it at right angles, generating higher pressure and efficiency for directing airflow in various applications. Both types are crucial in enhancing air circulation in residential and commercial settings.</p></p>
