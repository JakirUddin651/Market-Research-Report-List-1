<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Float Level Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Switch Type</li><li>Continuous Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Mechanical float level sensors are essential for liquid level detection, categorized into two main types: switch type and continuous type. Switch type sensors operate by triggering an ON/OFF signal when the float reaches specific levels, making them ideal for applications requiring discrete level control. In contrast, continuous type sensors provide real-time level monitoring over a range, utilizing variable resistance or capacitance for precise measurements. This versatility makes both types suitable for diverse industries, including water treatment, petrochemicals, and food processing.</p></p>
