<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Linear CMOS Image Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front Side Illuminated Linear CMOS Image Sensors</li><li>Back Side Illuminated Linear CMOS Image Sensors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The linear CMOS image sensor market is divided into two primary types: Front Side Illuminated (FSI) and Back Side Illuminated (BSI) sensors. FSI sensors capture light on the front side, relying on an arrangement that can limit sensitivity in low-light conditions. Conversely, BSI sensors have a design that allows light to hit the photodiode directly, enhancing sensitivity and performance, especially in dim lighting. This distinction drives application preferences in fields like industrial imaging, scientific research, and consumer electronics.</p></p>
